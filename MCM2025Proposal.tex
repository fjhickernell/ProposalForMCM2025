15th International Conference on Monte Carlo Methods and Applications (MCM)\\
MCM 2025 in Chicago, IL USA}

\maketitle

\section{Summary of the proposal}
MCM has a long history of bringing together theorists and practitioners of Monte Carlo methods from various disciplines.  We propose that MCM 2025 be held in Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.  Greater Chicago is home to several research universities and two United States Department of Energy research laboratories.  Chicago is a major transportation hub, which will facilitate scholars from all over the world coming together to share the latest developments in Monte Carlo methods. We hope that the MCM Steering Committee will accept our proposal and welcome all questions and suggestions.

\section{Local organization}
The local organizers are excited by the prospect of hosting MCM 2025 at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), which is situated a few miles south of downtown and accessible by public transportation. During the proposed dates of the conference there will be ample access to IIT facilities.  The conference will be held at Hermann Hall. A conference dinner will be organized on a cruise of the Chicago River with a fireworks display. 

Given changes wrought by COVID-19, we will be open to the possibility offering MCM 2025 in hybrid mode.  There are great challenges and difficulties in promoting interaction when some participants are onsite and others online.  However, there are uncertainties about travel restrictions three years from now.  The decision of going hybrid will be made in consultation with the Steering Committee starting in 2024.

The local organizing committee draws upon multiple disciplines and universities, which will help us in attracting broad participation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Fred Hickernell, Applied Mathematics, Illinois Institute of Technology
    \item  Lulu Kang, Applied Mathematics, Illinois Institute of Technology
    \item  Yuhan Ding, Applied Mathematics, Illinois Institute of Technology
    \item  David Minh, Chemistry, Illinois Institute of Technology
    \item  Yiou Li, Mathematical Sciences, DePaul University
\end{itemize}
The local organizing committee will draw upon students to assist with conference logistics.

\section{Program Committee}
The program committee will be an international and multidisciplinary in nature.  It will be drawn from those who have had a history of contribution to the MCM series plus those whose expertise may add a valuable dimension to the conference.  We have not contacted potential members yet, but are willing have the Steering Committee vet potential members if desired.

\section{Proceedings}

Given the history of MCM, we would be interested in seeing selected manuscripts published in a conference proceedings, either as a volume in a series or a special issue of a journal.  Since this is a long-term issue, we would be interested in the Steering Committee's views.

\section{Tentative Dates and Schedules}

We propose to hold the conference from Monday, July 28 to Friday, August 1, 2025.  This should situate MCM 2025 during the summer break (in the northern hemisphere), one week before the 2025 SIAM Annual Meeting, and not in conflict with the Joint Statistics Meeting.  This four and a half day conference will feature eight plenary talks of 50 minutes each, plus eight slots for parallel sessions, which will feature special sessions and contributed talks with 4 talks of 25 minutes each per session.
There will be a poster sessions on Wednesday occurring over an extended lunch

\section{Topics}
The MCM Conference is a biennial meeting on Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
The conference will be open to usual active topics of MCM conferences, but we will
also make effort to include emerging topics coming from applications.  It focuses on recent research related to the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Markov chain Monte Carlo
\item Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
\item Sequential Monte Carlo, particle filters
\item Non-equilibrium candidate Monte Carlo
\item Bridge sampling
\item Rare event simulation
\item Multi-level Monte Carlo
\item (Randomized) Quasi-Monte Carlo
\item Digital nets and lattice rules
\item Discrepancy theory
\item Complexity and tractability of multivariate problems
\item Variance reduction
\item Monte Carlo Simulation on High-Performance Architectures
\item Uncertainty quantification
\item Experimental design
\item Generative models from artificial intelligence
\item Variational inference
\item Probabilistic numerics
\item Monte Carlo methods for quantum computers
\item Stochastic gradient and other stochastic optimization methods
\item Statistical learning and Monte Carlo sampling
\item Reinforcement learning and control
\item Bayesian Inference
\item Computational statistical physics
\item Economic, Engineering, Industrial, and Scientific Applications
\end{itemize}

%\ny{My question is: It seems Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is a method of MCMC. Should we list it as a separate topic?}


\section{Budget}
The registration fees would be USD600/person including the conf. dinner, coffee/lunch breaks. Only expenses from keynote speakers will be covered. Expected number of participants is 150. For students, the registration fees would be USD250/person. Expected number of students is 50. The sponsorship will come from our collaborators: IMSI, CISC, and the Center for Stochastic Dynamics and Computation.
